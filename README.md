### Tristan Notes

**Approach**: I first implemented the API call in my data component. I accomplished this using "fetch" and some basic state variables for the data and whether or not it was loading. Once I had the call working, I decided to create some interfaces for the data so I could easily and safely access it the component later on. I created a ApiResponse, Record, and Error interface. With those working, I then quickly setup a table to display the data. I decided to use tailwind for speed and ease-of-use. After I had the basic display up, I focused on the conditional formatting section. To accomplish this, I wrote a basic function that input a record, and output a conditionally formatted cell element depending on the record values. For the tooltip, I decided to utilize MaterialUI once again for speed and ease-of-use. For the CSV export, I candidly did some searching and found a basic solution utilizing blob and some basic row parsing. Lastly, for the error modal, I decided to continue using MaterialUI and utilized their basic Button/Modal components. 

**Improvements**: Firstly, with more time I would dedicate cycles to the UI/UX. It's not exactly very aesthetic or pretty as it stands. I'd like to change the fonts, make the coloring and button more uniform, and add some addition text explaining the features on the page. Furthermore, I'd like to add pagination, more robust conditional formatting, and additional options for export. 


### **Take-Home Assignment: Data Review, Editor, and Exporter**

**Objective**: Build a data review interface that queries JSON data from a Next.js API, displays the data in a table format with validation errors, and allows users to export the data in CSV format. You will also color-code validation errors and provide error details in an interactive way.

**Deliverables**:

1. **Data Query from API**: Implement a Next.js API route that returns the provided mock JSON data (attached below).
2. **Data Review Table**:
    - Display the data in a table, flattening any nested fields (e.g., `address`) into separate columns (e.g., `Street`, `City`, `Zipcode`).
    - Color-code validation errors in each column according to severity:
        - Red for critical errors (must be fixed).
        - Yellow for warnings (should be reviewed).
        - Green for valid fields.
    - **Hoverable Error Messages**: Each cell with a validation error should display the error message on hover as a tooltip.
    - **Error Summary Modal**: Include an "Error Summary" modal with a clickable button or link that opens a modal. This modal should list all the validation errors for that specific row, with details for each error.
3. **CSV Export**: Allow users to export the data to a CSV format.


**Design Considerations**:

- **No Figma Provided**: We have deliberately not provided Figma or design assets for this project. This is to give you the freedom to design the table and modals as you see fit. Part of the evaluation will be based on your ability to create a user-friendly, intuitive UI without strict design guidelines. You're free to choose the best layout, color schemes, and UX patterns, and UI Libraries that fit the task.


**Mock Data**: You will be working with the following mock JSON data. The data will always follow a static model. Your API should serve this data to the frontend:

```json
{
  "records": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "john.doe@example.com",
      "street": "123 Main St",
      "city": "New York",
      "zipcode": "12345",
      "phone": "123-456-7890",
      "status": "active",
      "errors": {
        "phone": {
          "message": "Invalid phone format",
          "severity": "critical"
        },
        "zipcode": {
          "message": "Invalid zipcode",
          "severity": "warning"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "Jane Smith",
      "email": "jane.smith@sample",
      "street": "456 Elm St",
      "city": "Los Angeles",
      "zipcode": "",
      "phone": "987-654-3210",
      "status": "inactive",
      "errors": {
        "email": {
          "message": "Invalid email format",
          "severity": "critical"
        },
        "zipcode": {
          "message": "Zipcode is missing",
          "severity": "critical"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "name": "Alice Johnson",
      "email": "alice.johnson@example.com",
      "street": "",
      "city": "Chicago",
      "zipcode": "60614",
      "phone": "111-222-3333",
      "status": "pending",
      "errors": {
        "street": {
          "message": "Street address is missing",
          "severity": "warning"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}

```

**Expectations**:

- **Tech Stack**: Use **Next.js** for API and server-side rendering, React for frontend components. Styling can be done with **Tailwind CSS** or your **UI library of choice**.
- **Time Estimation**: This assignment should take 4â€“6 hours to complete.
- **Submission**: Please fork this repo, and provide a GitHub repo link containing your code, with a README explaining your approach, assumptions, and any improvements you would make given more time.
